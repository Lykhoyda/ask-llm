2026-07-02 audit hardening batch (ADR-128):

- **shared**: new canonical `PROVIDERS` tuple + `ProviderName` type (single source of truth for the provider list); new `relativeDirSchema` for includeDirs-style params; `ASK_OLLAMA_TIMEOUT_MS` / `DEFAULT_OLLAMA_TIMEOUT_MS` in `EXECUTION`; chunkCache now creates its dir 0700 and chunk files 0600 (and tightens dirs from older releases); `registerTools()` fails fast on duplicate tool names; stderr accumulation switched to `Buffer[]` (parity with stdout).
- **ollama**: the `/api/chat` call finally has a timeout — `AbortController` bounded by `ASK_OLLAMA_TIMEOUT_MS` > `GMCPT_TIMEOUT_MS` > 600s default, with an actionable timeout error; previously a wedged Ollama server hung `ask-ollama` forever.
- **codex**: JSONL output that parses into events but contains no agent message now throws an actionable error (naming the thread id, with truncated raw output) instead of returning the raw JSONL dump as the "response"; plain-text output still passes through. `includeDirs` on `ask-codex`/`ask-codex-edit` now validates paths (relative only, no `..`/`~`) — parity with `ask-gemini-edit`.
- **gemini**: empty-string `sessionId` now bypasses the response cache (parity with codex/ollama, ADR-063 semantics) — previously a cached body with `sessionId: undefined` was returned instead of performing the session turn; includeDirs cache-key construction no longer mutates the caller's array.
- **llm-mcp**: `multi-llm` outputSchema and the no-providers-detected fallback enum now include `antigravity` (previously the declared contract rejected antigravity usage stats); REPL `/provider` help derives from the provider registry.
- **plugin**: plugin.json + marketplace.json description/keywords now name Antigravity; manifest tests assert all four runner binaries.
