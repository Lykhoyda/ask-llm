### Patch Changes

- [#279](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/pull/279) [`9d27169`](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/commit/9d27169fbe22c2ffbfae0be9d6cba841b98e42f1) Thanks [@Lykhoyda](https://github.com/Lykhoyda)! - Add first-class Grok consultations through explicit xAI API or official Grok CLI harnesses, with exact model selection, strict no-fallback diagnostics, redacted credentials, cancellation, telemetry, and opt-in live tests. Add a separate model-neutral Cursor Agent harness that requires provider and exact Cursor model attribution, runs read-only, and never changes trust or spend settings. The Cursor provider enum is `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `grok` in the unified server and Pi, and the requested model must belong to that family (Auto and noncanonical IDs are refused); `AskResponse` gains an optional `reportedModel` carrying Cursor's display label while `model` echoes the exact requested catalog ID. Prompts above 16 KB reach Grok CLI through a private `--prompt-file` (only when `grok --help` advertises it; otherwise they fail before spawn) and Cursor Agent over stdin. xAI effort coercion (`xhigh` applied as `high` on older models) and served-model alias resolution are disclosed, and an effort-rejecting 4xx is classified with the supported list.
