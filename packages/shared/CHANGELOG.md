# @ask-llm/shared

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#126](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/pull/126) [`53c0708`](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/commit/53c07080f7e62355d18a4d423bf76a65ab473dc7) Thanks [@Lykhoyda](https://github.com/Lykhoyda)! - # Fix [#115](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/issues/115) — `npx ask-llm-mcp` ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND on Node 26 global install

  Publish `@ask-llm/shared` as a public npm package and remove the
  `bundledDependencies` mechanism from all four MCP packages
  (`ask-gemini-mcp`, `ask-codex-mcp`, `ask-ollama-mcp`, `ask-llm-mcp`).

  ## The bug

  External user (twardoch) on Node 26.0.0 reported that `npx ask-llm-mcp
doctor` and `npm install -g ask-llm-mcp` crash with:

  ```
  Error: Cannot find package '/.../node_modules/zod/index.js'
    imported from /.../node_modules/@ask-llm/shared/dist/askResponse.js
  Did you mean to import "zod/index.cjs"?
      at legacyMainResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:201:26)
  ```

  Reproduced exactly on Node 26.0.0 + npm 11.12.1. Root cause: npm 11
  global install has a bug where `bundledDependencies` packages are
  extracted correctly, but their declared transitive dependencies that
  _aren't_ bundled get empty placeholder directories (78 packages affected
  in our case — `zod`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `express`, `hono`,
  `jose`, `cors`, `ajv`, etc.). Node's ESM resolver finds the empty
  directory, falls into `legacyMainResolve`, and fails. The same exact
  tarball works perfectly when installed locally (`npm install
ask-llm-mcp` to a project directory) — the bug is specifically in
  global install.

  ## The fix (ADR-106)

  Remove the bundling mechanism that triggered the npm bug. Since
  `@ask-llm/shared` was the only `private: true` workspace package and
  the sole reason `bundledDependencies` existed (ADR-052), making it a
  public npm package eliminates the entire bundling code path.

  Changes:

  - `@ask-llm/shared` — removed `"private": true`, added
    `"publishConfig": { "access": "public" }`, added publishable metadata
    (description, repo, homepage, license, files). First public version
    ships in this release.
  - All four MCP packages — removed `bundledDependencies` array and the
    `prepack`/`postpack` scripts that called the custom bundling logic.
  - `scripts/prepack-bundle.mjs` + `scripts/postpack-restore.mjs` —
    deleted. Yarn 4 automatically rewrites `workspace:*` to the actual
    workspace version at publish time (more precisely than our custom
    `workspace:* → *` rewrite did).

  ## Trade-offs

  - Tarballs shrink dramatically: `ask-llm-mcp` drops from 202 files
    (~80KB) to ~31 files (~17KB) because shared/gemini/codex/ollama
    bundles are no longer inlined.
  - One more public npm package to maintain (`@ask-llm/shared`). Already
    versioned by changesets via `privatePackages: { version: true }`, so
    the only mechanical change is that it now publishes too.
  - Install flow becomes byte-identical between local and global —
    removing the bug class that bit us here.

  ## What does NOT change

  - Public APIs of any package
  - The set of MCP tools exposed
  - The Claude Code plugin (`@ask-llm/plugin` is unaffected — it's
    distributed via marketplace, not npm)
  - Any user-facing behavior other than "global install actually works"
